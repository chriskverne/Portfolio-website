          I&apos;m currently a junior at FIU fortunate to be supervised by Professor <Link className='text-blue-600 underline' target='blank' href={'https://www.cis.fiu.edu/faculty-staff/janki-bhimani/'}>Janki Bhimani</Link> in 
          the <Link className='text-blue-600 underline' href={'https://damrl.cis.fiu.edu/'} target='_blank'>DaMRL</Link> lab.
          My research interests include <b>Optimization TheoryðŸ“ˆ</b>, <b>Statistical Inference ðŸ§®</b>, and <b>Deep LearningðŸ§ </b>.

          This question drives my current research interests. I am fascinated by the mathematical principles that underlie learning and reasoning â€” particularly within the framework of statistical learning theory and optimization. My work focuses on understanding the fundamental limits of learning systems: how algorithms generalize, converge, and adapt under various data and computational constraints.
